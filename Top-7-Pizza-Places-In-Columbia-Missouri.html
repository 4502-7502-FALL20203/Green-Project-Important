      <h1>Top 7 Pizza Places in Columbia</h1>
      <p>Now Columbia isn’t Chicago or New York or any city in Italy or any place that would attempt to claim aspot as one of the top pizza municipalities in the world but Columbia has it’s locations. In this list, Iwill break down which places are the must-visit stops to get a nice cheesy slice of Pizza. This list will not include any global chain restaurant like Papa Johns's or Domino's (Papa Johns is better).</p>

					<h2>Pizza Tree</h2>
					<address>
						909 Cherry St<br>
						Columbia, MO<br>
						65201<br>
						<a href="tel:+15738749925>(573)-874-9925</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="https://www.pizzatreepizza.com>" Visit Pizza Tree's website</a></p>
					<p>One of the best locations to get a by-the-slice pizza in the midwest, Pizza Tree never misses on flavor or quality of cooking.</p>

					<h2>Gumby's</h2>
					<address>
						1201 E Broadway<br>
						Columbia, MO<br>
						65201<br>
						<a href="tel:+15738748629">(573) 874-8629</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="https://gumbyscolumbia.hungerrush.com/">Visit Gumby's website</a></p>
					<p>Unfortunately, this is a chain restaurant which caused me to change the requirements to allow for some chain restaurant. However, this place never misses, they have a huge variety of pizzas
and every one of them is cooked to perfection.</p>

					<h2>Shakespeare's Pizza</h2>
					<address>
						225 S Ninth Street<br>
						Columbia, MO<br>
						65201<br>
						<a href="tel:+15734492454">573 449-2454</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="shakespeares.com
					">Visit Shakespeare's website</a></p>
					<p>A chain restaurant that doesn’t stretch past Columbia city limits, Shakespeare’s is the staple of pizza in Columbia, Missouri, a classic. Some have said the pizza is too goopy, but I think it tastes great.</p>

					<h2>Pappos</h2>
					<address>
						10 W Nifong Blvd<br>
						Columbia, MO<br>
						65203<br>
						<a href="tel:+15738181790">(573) 818-190</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="pappospizzeria.com">Visit Pappos website</a></p>
					<p>A Missouri and Illinois attraction, Pappos may not be in my top 3 pizza locations, but it certainly competes with the help of some of its exquisite appetizers like Garlic Cheese Bread, Breadsticks, or wings that come with a variety of sauces such as Buffalo, KC BBQ and Mango Habanero.</p>

					<h2>Wiseguys</h2>
					<address>
						7 N 6th St<br>
						Columbia, MO<br>
						65201<br>
						<a href="tel:+15734437777">(573) 443-7777</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="https://drakescomeplay.com/locations/drakes-ofallon-mo/">mcnallys.biz</a></p>
					<p>A place that might be more well-known for its wings, also has a superb pizza. This shop can be hard to miss as it's attached to the McNally's bar in the back. However, if you are able to find it, you have to try the bbq pizza, it is god's gift to earth.</p>

					<h2>Your Pie</h2>
					<address>
						1413 Grindstone Plaza<br>
						Columbia, MO<br>
						65203<br>
						<a href="tel:+15738758750">(573) 875-8750</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="https://yourpie.com/locations/columbia/">Visit Wiseguys' website</a></p>
					<p>The unique options that Columbia has in pizza places starts to end here. However, if you go to Columbia’s Your Pie location at the shopping complex off of Grindstone and get a Buffalo Chicken, you’ll be set up for a great day in the 573. </p>

					<h2>Tony's Pizza Palace</h2>
					<address>
						17 N 5th St<br>
						Columbia, MO<br>
						65201<br>
						<a href="tel:+15734423188">(573) 442-3188</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Tonys-Pizza-Palace-Columbia-100063614801407/">Visit Tony's Pizza Palace</a></p>
					<p>This is a location that’s maybe not so well-known in Columbia. However, I went here after work one
time to get a Meat Lovers pizza and it was one of the best pizzas I had. The only factor putting this
place at the bottom is that I’ve only been here once.
