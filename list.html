      <h1>Top 10 True Story Sports Movies</h1>
      
      <p class="pagesummary">
        Sports movies hold a unique status compared to other true story films in that we can get our hero’s victory in a setting that isn’t as personal or violent as other movies can be. They’re not immune from tragedy such as the death of Gerry in Remember the Titans or the bitterness in Glory Road when racists vandalize their hotel rooms. Sports movies have the advantage of taking a non-controversial situation such as a sports game and playing along any emotions they want. Here’s my list:</h2>

          <li>#10 A League of Their Own</li>
        </div>

        <p>This 1992 feminist icon movie does a fantastic job of encapsulating the effort women carried throughout World War 2. Tom Hanks as Jimmy Dugan, a tough no-nonsense coach, took us through the highs and lows of trying to coach a bunch of women who had hardly played any sports before treated just like male players. The Rockford Peaches carried the show in real life while players like Lou Gehrig and Yogi Berra fought in the Second Great War.</p>

        <li>#9 I,Tonya</li>
        </div>

        <p>
Tonya Harding is one of the most infamous villains in sports history, or is she? The 2017 movie starred by Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan sheds light on the side of the story many don’t often hear. We get to learn about her life with an abusive mom and an even more abusive, but more manipulative husband, while also learning about the nuisances to what went behind that day when Nancy Kerrigan was attacked as she was about to start practice. Say what you want, but I had no idea that she was mostly unaware of what was going to happen in the attack. At one point in time I thought it was her who did it. This movie doesn’t justify her actions but it makes her a little less unlikeable.</p>

        <li>#8 Million Dollar Arm</li>
      </div>

      <p>
This 2014 film starred by Jon Hamm (Mizzou legend) takes us through the wild and unconventional recruiting story as J.B. Bernstein gets two Indian cricket players to play for the Oakland Athletics of the Major League Baseball Association. Can you imagine the stories all three of those guys have? They were horrendous at first, but every viewer’s heart would begin to flutter as they began to find success and even earn playing time at the highest stage. How can you not love it?

        <li>#7 Race</li>
      </div>

      <p>This 2016 film starring Stephan James as Jesse Owens and Jason Sudeikis as Coach Larry Snyder brings us through the ultimate roller coaster journey of a successful black athlete in the 1930s. Jesse Owens crushed the competition at the collegiate level and the Olympic level, even in an event he competed in which he hadn’t run before due to two Jewish athletes being told they couldn’t run. After winning four gold medals for Team USA, we are taken through the ultimate heartbreak when he has to go through the service entrance at his own banquet.</p>

      <li>#6 Secretariat</li>
    </div>

    <p>I’m not a horse guy but this movie had me on the edge of my seat. Who would’ve ever guessed one of the most successful horses was the result of a losing coin toss? The genetically superior horse with a heart three times the size of most horses brought the sport of horse racing to new heights becoming the first horse to win the Triple Crown in 25 years.</p>

      <li>#5 Hoosiers</li>
    </div>

    <p>Failed college coach Norman Dale, played by Gene Hackman, gets a chance at redemption when he is hired to direct the basketball program of a high school in a tiny Indiana town. This 1986 movie became the nightmare fuel of basketball players around the world who were told to pass the ball at least four times before shooting. Ultimately the Hickory Huskies, based on the 1954 Milan High School team, sunk the buzzer-beater and won the state championship.</p>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <li>#4 Miracle</li>
    </div>

    <p>This 2004 film takes the story of maybe the greatest upset in sports history to new heights. Kurt Russell, who plays Coach Herb Brooks, did a fantastic job encapsulating the struggle of taking a bunch of walk-on tryouts to the Olympics, and taking down the most dominant force in the entire world in the sport of Hockey, the Soviet Union. The 4-3 victory brought Americans together closer than they had ever been since maybe the moon landing.</p>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <li>#3 Blindside</li>
  </div>

  </p>Although recently in the news for embellishing some details, this movie potentially rivals Miracle for best underdog story, or maybe the next two movies do. However, Mrs. Touhy, played by Sandra Bullock, is the ultimate girl boss who took in an abandoned soul and gave him a place to flourish. How much of the details are fabricated? I’m not sure but the love between Michael Oher and the Touhy’s in the film is the ideal standard for family life.</p>

    <div class="list-heads">
      <li>#2 Glory Road</li>
    </div>

    <p>I might be biased, (’m definitely biased) but if I had saw this movie without personally knowing one of the players from the team, I still would’ve highly rated this movie. The Texas Western team, coach by Don Haskins, played by Josh Lucas took a bunch of underlooked scouts all the way to the top. Like Jesse Owens, no matter how much success this team achieved it was not enough to shield them from extreme racism as Nevil Shed (my former coach who denies this story) was beaten up in a restaurant bathroom. Later on the team’s hotel rooms are vandalized. However through it all and in the greatest stage of college basketball, the ultimate surprise, Don Haskins benches every white player. I can’t imagine they were as understanding in real life, however, to see this team of black athletes beat the juggernaut Kentucky Wildcats with Jerry West playing was awesome.</p>

      <div class="list-heads">
       <li>#1 Remember the Titans</li>
     </div>

     <p>“Left Side! Strong Side! Left Side! Strong Side!” The newly integrated Alexandria City High School coached by Herman Boone, played by Denzel Washington, does a better job of character development than any sports movie I’ve seen. Even skinny no good safety Ryan Gosling has an appeal to his character. The team won the Virginia state championship, they went through racism as coach Boone’s house is vandalized and the black players are discriminated at school and restaurants, it's all very well portrayed. However, the bromance between Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell is the coolest thing ever. They started off fighting in their dorm room at summer camp and finished off with Bertier calling Campbell his brother as he lies in the hospital bed when the nurse tells Campbell only family is allowed in the room?? “Alice, are you blind? Don’t you see the family resemblance? That’s my brother." Tears. Instant tears.</p>
